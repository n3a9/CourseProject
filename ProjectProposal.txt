CS410 Project Proposal

1. Team
Captain: Neeraj Aggarwal, noa2
Rishi Wadhwa, rishiw2
Samarth Keshari, keshari2

2. Competition: text classification competition

3. Yes, we are prepared to learn state-of-the-art neural network classifiers. We’ve heard of Tensorflow, PyTorch, and LSTM. We have relevant experience with text classification, neural networks, relisiency. We aren’t experts, but we have dabbled in some of these methods in our pasts.

4. Programming Language: Python
